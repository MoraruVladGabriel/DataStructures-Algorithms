- Abstract data type
- LIFO : Last in, first out
- push : adds an item as the top item on the stack
- pop : removes the top item on the stack
- peek : gets the top item on the stack
- Ideal backing data structure : linked list

- O(1) for push, pop, and peek, when using a linked list
- If you use an array, then push is O(n), because the array may have to be resized
- If you know the maximum number of items the will ever be on the stack, an array can be a good choice
- If memory is tight, an array might be a good choice
- Linked list is ideal
